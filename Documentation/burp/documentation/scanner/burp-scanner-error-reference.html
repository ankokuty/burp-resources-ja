            <h4><code>Can't find existing log file!</code></h4>
        </summary>
        <div class="content">
            <h5>Cause</h5><p>
                Our technical support team may have asked you to enable debug logging for a scan in order to help diagnose a problem you reported. This creates a log file called something like <code>crawlDebug-1-1234567890123.log</code> when the scan runs. Burp Suite tried to load a scan at startup, but could not find the associated log file. This could be because it has been moved or deleted.
            </p>
            <h5>Remedy</h5><p>
                If you moved this file from its original location, put it back and try again. To find the expected location:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    From the Burp's Dashboard tab, click the settings icon for the related scan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go to the <strong>Scan Configuration</strong> settings, select the relevant crawl configuration, then click <strong>Edit</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under <strong>Crawl Optimization</strong>, click the settings icon next to the Crawl strategy menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the Directory field.
                </li>

                <h5>注</h5><p>
                    The logging option is not recommended for normal operation. Generally speaking, you should only enable it when asked to do so by our support team.

            <h5>Cause</h5><p>
                Our technical support team may have told you to enable debug logging for a scan in order to help diagnose a problem you reported. This creates a log file called something like <code>crawlDebug-1-1234567890123.log</code> when the scan runs. Burp Scanner encountered errors while trying to write to this file. This could be caused by permissions or other file system problems with the location you have selected for the log file.
            </p>
            <h5>Remedy</h5><p>
                Make sure that the burpsuite user has permission to write to the specified directory, or select a different directory to save the log file in.

            <h5>Cause</h5><p>
                During the crawl phase, the scan can automatically be paused if more than a certain percentage of requests fail. This prevents the scan from needlessly crawling a site that is currently down, for example.
            </p>
            <h5>Remedy</h5><p>
                Check that the web application being scanned is still running and accessible.

                Burp Scanner was unable to send requests to any of the specified <strong>URLs to scan</strong>. This error can be caused by anything that prevents Burp Scanner from connecting to the URL. This can include timeouts, connection failed errors, and problems resolving hostnames.

            <h5>Remedy</h5><ul>
                <li>
                    Check for typos and other errors in the <strong>URLs to Scan</strong>.
                </li>

                    Check that you are able to connect to the target application from the machine running the scan.

                    If you have any trouble doing this, troubleshoot your connection to the hostname that is failing.

                <li>
                    Check the firewall, proxy, and DNS server settings for the machine running the scan.

                Burp Scanner was unable to start the embedded browser. This can be caused by various issues with the embedded browser.

                Run the <a href="../desktop/functions/embedded-browser.html#embedded-browser-health-check">Embedded browser health check</a> from the <strong>Help</strong> menu in Burp Suite. This will diagnose problems with the embedded browser.

            <h5>Cause</h5><p>
                Burp Scanner's crawl engine sometimes gets updated in such a way that it cannot open files created in previous versions. While this happens relatively infrequently, it can happen when adding new features or significantly changing how it operates.
            </p>
            <h5>Remedy</h5><p>
                Recreate your scan in the new version.
